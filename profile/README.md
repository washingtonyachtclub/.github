# Welcome to the official Github of the Washington Yacht Club
These sites were originally created in the late 90s/early 2000s, much has changed since then but these sites are still useful.

Hopefully I'll make some time this summer to properly write this introduction page, but in the meantime have fun!

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
